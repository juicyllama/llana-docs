# WebSockets

Llana ships with WebSockets so you can keep your frontend applications fully synchronized with your database.

## Socket Connection

WebSockets use the same [Hosts](/configuration#hosts) and [Authentication](/configuration#authentication) settings as the main API endpoints. If you have user authentication setup then the WebSockets expect a a JWT token to be passed either as as a Bearer token or via the `Auth > Token` value:

```ts
import { io } from "socket.io-client";
import { $llanaInstanceUrl, $llanaAccessToken } from "@/plugins/llana"

export const socket = io($llanaInstanceUrl, {
	auth: {
		token: `Bearer ${jwt_token}`,
		'x-llana-table': table,
	},
});
```

It is important to pass your `table` in the `extraHeaders > x-llana-table` value, as we will use this to check permissions during the socket creation process.

The JWT token is obtainable from the login endpoint.

## Subscribing

You can subscribe to specific table updates, you will receive payloads as follows:

```ts
{
    type: 'INSERT' | 'UPDATE' | 'DELETE'
	[table_primary_key]: string | number
}
```

Here is an example subscription to the `users_notifications` table via a Pinia Store:

```ts
export const useNotificationsStore = defineStore('notificationStore', {
	state: () => <ListResponse<Notification>>defaultList(),
	actions: {
		bindEvents() {
			try{
				socket.on(users_notifications, (data: SocketData) => {
					switch (data.type) {
						case 'INSERT':
						case 'UPDATE':
							this.getNotification(data.id)
							break
						case 'DELETE':
							this.deleteNotification(data.id)
							break
					}
				});
			}catch(e: any){
				console.error(e)
				socket.off(table)
			}
		  },
    }
})
```

If you are using our frontend plugins like [Nuxt](/integrations/nuxt), we handle the WebSocket integration automatically.

## Optional Configuration

The following `.env` values can be used: 

|Variable | Details|
|--------|---------|
|`CACHE_WS_IDENTITY_DATA_TTL`  | The TTL for caching websocket identities, defaults to `2 days`  |

## Multi-Server Setup

When deploying **Llana** in a **multi-server environment**, additional configuration is required to ensure that WebSocket connections are synchronized across all servers in the cluster. By default, WebSockets will only function in a **single-instance** setup. In a cluster, servers must communicate with each other using **Redis**.

### Setting Up Redis for WebSocket Communication

To enable WebSocket functionality in a multi-server cluster:

1. **Install Redis**  
   Ensure that a Redis server is installed and running. This can be on the same machine (localhost) or on a dedicated Redis server.

2. **Add Redis Configuration to `.env`**  
   Include the following environment variables in your `.env` file to configure Redis:

   ```env
   REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1  # Replace with your Redis server's IP address
   REDIS_PORT=6379       # Replace with your Redis server's port
   ```

   - **`REDIS_HOST`**: The hostname or IP address of the Redis server.
   - **`REDIS_PORT`**: The port number Redis is running on.

3. **Cluster Communication**  
   When Redis is configured, the WebSocket servers will use Redis Pub/Sub to synchronize state and events across all instances in the cluster. This ensures seamless real-time communication regardless of which server the WebSocket client connects to.

### Without Redis

If Redis is not set up, WebSockets will only work in a **single-instance** setup. This means:

- Clients connected to one server will not receive WebSocket updates from another server in the cluster.
- This limitation can cause inconsistent real-time behavior in multi-server deployments.

To ensure full functionality in a multi-server environment, Redis is a **mandatory requirement for multi-instance setups**.

---

### Example Redis Deployment

For a production setup, you can deploy Redis using Docker:

```bash
docker run -d --name redis -p 6379:6379 redis
```

Ensure the `REDIS_HOST` points to the Docker containerâ€™s IP (or localhost if running locally).

---

### Verifying the Setup

Once Redis is configured and your `.env` file updated:

1. Restart all servers to ensure they pick up the new Redis configuration.
2. Make sure the following warning does NOT appear on the boot: `REDIS_PORT or REDIS_HOST not found - Websockets will NOT work in a multi-instance setup`

With Redis properly set up, your multi-server deployment will fully support WebSockets, keeping your application synchronized in real time.
