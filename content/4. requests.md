# Building Requests

## Fields

You can specify which fields you would like to return, defaults to `*`

Example `?fields=orderId,shipName,Customer.ContactName`

## Relations

You can fetch deeper content by passing relations, assuming their is a foreign key connection it will return the deep result.

Example `?relations=Customer`

*Warning*: In our attempt to keep the relations implementation simple we will always return an array, this simplifies your implementation as you don't need to check if it's an object or array.

## Pagination 

Pass `&page=` into subsequent requests to load a specific page results, or alternatively use the `limit` and `offset` values directly:

```
"pagination": {
        "total": number, //total results in this page
        "page": {
            "current": string, //the page ref for the current page
            "prev": string, //the page ref for the previous page (if applicable)
            "next": string, //the page ref for the next page (if applicable)
            "first": string,
            "last": string
        }
    },
```

## Filtering

Filter results by passing query parameters like `column[operator]=value`
      
Example: `?city=Barcelona` or `?city[equals]=Barcelona`

Operators are:

| Operator   | SQL Equivalent | Description                                |
|------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| equals     | =              | Field data should match input value         |
| not_equals | !=             | Field data should not match input value     |
| lt         | <              | The value is less than the input value      |
| lte        | <=             | The value is less than or equal to the input value |
| gt         | >              | The value is greater than the input value   |
| gte        | >=             | The value is greater than or equal to the input value |
| like       | LIKE           | Field data should match a pattern           |
| not_like   | NOT LIKE       | Field data should not match a pattern       |
| in         | IN             | Field data should be in a list of values    |
| not_in     | NOT IN         | Field data should not be in a list of values |
| null       | IS NULL        | Field data should be null                   |
| not_null   | IS NOT NULL    | Field data should not be null               |
| search     | SEARCH         | Field data should match a full-text search query |

## Sorting

format is sort={column}.{direction},column.{direction}

`?sort=contactName.asc,custId.desc`
