# Configuration 

Llana's basic implementation can be configured quickly using `.env` values which will connect to your data source and configure other basic options.

More advanced configuration is done via data tables (`_llana_*`) which we add dynamically to your data source.

We do this to ensure the application is fully cloud based and there is no dependency on the file system.

## Database

Replace the database connection string `DATABASE_URI` in the `.env` file.

[See data sources](/data-sources/overview) for more information.

## Hosts

You can lock down requests to specific origins by passing a comma separated list of IP addresses via the `.env` `HOSTS` property.

*Warning*: By default the system has no hosts and is open to all. If you are not operating a public application, we highly recommend you restrict your application to known services.

```
HOSTS="127.0.0.1,192.168.0.1"
```

*Note*: We are looking at the `x-real-ip` header value, so any proxy service will likely result in a failed host check.

## Authentication 

As standard we ship with two types of authentication with some examples added, however if you are developing a public application you can skip authentication by adding `SKIP_AUTH=true` to your `.env` file.

This will remove the need for any user authentication and make all your endpoints public. If you want to change public permisisons or unlock tables for public consumption, see [Public Tables](/configuration#public-tables). 

#### API KEY

Here are the configuration settings and their default settings:

|Env Key | Default | Details|
|--------|---------|--------|
|`AUTH_USER_API_KEY_LOCATION` | `HEADER` | The location of where the API Key is passed in the requests, options are: `HEADER` `QUERY` `BODY`|
|`AUTH_USER_API_KEY_NAME` | `x-api-key` | The key of the key:value pair passed, e.g. `x-api-key:YOURKEY` |
|`AUTH_USER_TABLE_NAME` | `User` | The main identity table containing your user identity|
|`AUTH_USER_IDENTITY_COLUMN` | undefined | The column containing your users identity key in your users identity table, defaults to the primary key of the identity table|
|`AUTH_USER_API_KEY_FIELD`| `UserApiKey.apiKey` | The column of the users API key accessed from the main identity table|

*Note*: if you specify a `SOFT_DELETE_COLUMN` it will ensure this value is `NULL` before authorizing.

#### JWT Token

We provide some special endpoints that allows you to exchange a username/password for a `access_token`. You can then pass the access token in future requests.

*Login*

Example Request:

```
POST `/auth/login`

body: {
  username: test@test.com,
  password: test
}

```

Example Response: 

```
{
    "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOjEsInVzZXJuYW1lIjoidGVzdEB0ZXN0LmNvbSIsImlhdCI6MTcyNTM1NDI4OCwiZXhwIjoxNzI1NDQwNjg4fQ.Wb_Y6y1Mkb0xrhUX57s2XlKtqeZ5L68wNCVMWT8wFJw",
    "id": 1
}
```

*Profile*

You can test your access token by using the `/auth/profile` endpoint which also returns your users table data.

```
GET `/auth/profile`
```

Example Response: 

```
{
    "id": 1,
    "email": "test@test.com",
    "first_name": "Jon",
    "last_name": "Doe"
}
```

#### JWT Configuration  

You will need to add / update your `.env` values to fit your database schema:

|Env Key | Default | Details|
|--------|---------|--------|
|`AUTH_USER_TABLE_NAME` | `User` | The main identity table containing your user identity|
|`AUTH_USER_IDENTITY_COLUMN` | undefined | The column containing your users identity key, defaults to the primary key of the identity table|
|`AUTH_USER_TABLE_USERNAME_FIELD`| `email` | The column of your username field in the user identity table|
|`AUTH_USER_TABLE_PASSWORD_FIELD`| `password` | The column of your password field in the user identity table|
|`AUTH_USER_TABLE_PASSWORD_ENCRYPTION`| `BCRYPT` | The encoding type for your password field, options are: `BCRYPT` `SHA1`, `SHA256`, `SHA512`, `MD5`, `ARGON2`|
|`AUTH_USER_TABLE_PASSWORD_SALT`| 10 | Optional salt used in conjunction with the encryption |
|`BASE_URL_API` | | Base URL for your Llana backend API, used for making API requests and securing JWT cookies. For example `http://localhost:3000` if you're working locally, or `http://your-llana-backend-url.com`  |
|`BASE_URL_APP` | | Base URL for your Llana frontend application, used for linking frontend resources. Must be configured correctly to allow cross-origin (CORS) communication with JWT cookies between your frontend and backend. For example `http://localhost:3001` if you're working locally, or `http://your-llana-frontend-url.com` |
|`AUTH_COOKIES_DOMAIN` | | The domain to which authentication cookies should be restricted. This should be the top-level domain of your application’s front-end server. For example, if you're using Llana as your front-end, set this to `your-frontend-domain.com`. If you’re using a different front-end server, such as Next.js or Nuxt, use the domain corresponding to that server instead. If left unset, will default to the hostname of `BASE_URL_API` |
|`JWT_KEY` | | Secret key used for signing JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for user authentication. Keep this key confidential and secure. |
|`JWT_REFRESH_KEY` | | Secret key used for signing JWT refresh tokens, enabling secure token renewal. Keep this key confidential and secure. |
|`JWT_EXPIRES_IN` | `15m` | Expiration duration for regular JWT tokens, indicating how long a token remains valid. |
|`JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRES_IN` | `14d` | Expiration duration for JWT refresh tokens, specifying how long the refresh token is valid for token renewal. |


You can use NodeJS to generate secure JWT keys by running this command in a terminal:
```bash
$ node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"
```

#### Password Encryption

To help ensure user passwords are always stored in an encrypted format, we perform checks on `CREATE` and `UPDATE` requests. If the request includes an update to your users identity table and includes the password field, we will encrypt the password using your configures (or default) encryption method.

This means you can delegate the user password encryption entirely to Llana.

## Public Tables

By default authentications apply to all tables, however you can specify tables for public access and their access permissions.

You can maintain routes in the table `_llana_public_tables`.

|Field | Type | Details|
|--------|---------|--------|
|`table` | `string` | The table this rule applies to |
|`access_level` | `enum` | The permission level to the public, either `READ` `WRITE` `DELETE`|
|`allowed_fields` | `string` | A comma separated list of fields that are available |

This works well in combination with roles (see below) for giving access to relevant data across different access levels.

## Roles

User roles are an important part of granting the correct permissions to perform relevant actions on the API endpoints.

Firstly, you should configure where your roles are located:

|Env Key | Default | Details|
|--------|---------|--------|
|`ROLE_LOCATION_USER_TABLE_NAME` | `$AUTH_USER_TABLE_NAME` | The table containing your roles, defaults to your auth users table |
|`ROLE_LOCATION_USER_TABLE_ROLE_FIELD` | `role` | The column containing your users role type |
|`ROLE_LOCATION_USER_TABLE_IDENTITY_COLUMN`| `undefined` | The column containing your users identity key, defaults to the primary key of the identity table |

You can manage roles via the `_llana_role` table.

|Field | Type | Details|
|--------|---------|--------|
|`custom` | `boolean` | If this is a custom role (applies to specific endpoints) |
|`table` | `string` | If not default, which table does this restriction apply to |
|`identity_column` | `string` | If not default and the primary key of the table is not the user identifier, which column should be used to identify the user |
|`role` | `string` | The name of the role, which should match the value from your users role field |
|`records` | `enum` | The permission level for this role across all records in the table, either `NONE` `READ` `WRITE` `DELETE`|
|`own_records` | `enum` | The permission level for this role if it includes a reference back to the user identity (their own records) either `NONE` `READ` `WRITE` `DELETE`|
|`allowed_fields` | `string` | A comma separated list of fields that are available for this role |

By default we will add the following roles to the table if non-exist on application startup:

|Custom | Table | Identity | Role | Records | Own Records |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|---------|----------|
|`false` ||| `ADMIN` | `DELETE` |  | 
|`false` ||| `USER` | `READ` | | 
|`true` | `$AUTH_USER_TABLE_NAME` | | `ADMIN` | `DELETE` | `DELETE` | 
|`true` | `$AUTH_USER_TABLE_NAME` | | `USER` | `NONE` | `WRITE` | 
|`true` | `$AUTH_USER_API_KEY_TABLE_NAME` | `$AUTH_USER_API_KEY_TABLE_IDENTITY_COLUMN` | `ADMIN` | `DELETE` | `DELETE` | 
|`true` | `$AUTH_USER_API_KEY_TABLE_NAME` | `$AUTH_USER_API_KEY_TABLE_IDENTITY_COLUMN` | `USER` | `NONE` | `WRITE` |

Role permissions work progressively, which means:

* `DELETE` - Has full permission to `DELETE` `WRITE` and `READ` 
* `WRITE` - Can also `READ` records
* `READ` - Can only `READ` records and has no `WRITE` permissions
* `NONE` - Has no access to the table

If you want to cherry pick the data coming back to the user based on role, you can add a comma separated list of fields the user can see in the `allowed_fields` field, all other fields will be removed from the returned data.

If the user has insufficient permissions they will get a `403 Forbidden` response.

## Relations

In some situations you may have data sources which don't support relations but you still want a way of "relating" data together. 

Imagine having two Google Sheets and you want to link them in some way. You can create "manual references" which will allow Llana to perform the relationship binding for you.

You can manage relations via the `_llana_relation` table.

|Field | Type | Details|
|--------|---------|--------|
|`table` | `string` | The name of the data source for the relation  |
|`column` | `string` | The field name containing the lookup value |
|`org_table` | `string` | The name of the original data source |
|`org_column` | `string` | The name of the field, which should match the value from your data source relation field |

Example: 
```
{
  "table": "Customer",
  "column": "id",
  "org_table": "SalesOrder",
  "org_column": "CustId"
}
```

This will create the relation on the SalesOrder table and link any customers by CustId > Customer[id]

## System Cache

Out of the box we cache table schema and some user auth/identity data to help speed up requests and reduce load on the database. 

The cache is reset each time the application boots up, this means if you make database schema changes, you can simply reboot the application and the cache will be cleared.

This allows us to set a longer-lived cache ttl, however, if you want to change these, you can set the, in the `.env` file. Setting a ttl to `0` will result in no cache being used.

```
CACHE_TABLE_SCHEMA_TTL=3600000 #value in milliseconds
CACHE_IDENTITY_DATA_TTL=60000 #value in milliseconds
```

## Documentation

As standard we generate OpenApi JSON and a Redoc page which can be viewed from the homepage of your instance. You can disable docs by adding the `.env` value `SKIP_DOCS=true`

When the application boots up, it will build the OpenApi JSON schema based on your data source schema. If you make changes to your data source, simply reboot the application and the changes will be reflected in your documentation.

The OpenApi JSON is accessible via `/openapi.json`, you can use this to power postman or any 3rd party API tooling.

We use this to display a Redoc page at the root `/` of your instance. Here are the `.env` values you can customize.


|Env Value | Default |
|--------|---------|
|`DOCS_TITLE` | `API Documentation` |

## Deleting

As standard the delete endpoint will physically remove the record from your database. You can provide the `.env` value for `SOFT_DELETE_COLUMN` e.g. `deletedAt` or `deleted_at` to perform a soft delete across your database. 

If you are using soft delete, you can request a hard delete by passing the query param `?hard=true` with your delete request. Note: anything truthy with the `hard=` will skip the soft delete and perform a hard delete. 

## Logging

You can update logging levels via a `.env` value, for more details see: [Developers > Debugging/Logging](/developers/local-development#debugging-logging)

## Timezones

You can set a timezone globally using nodes default `TZ` value in your `.env`

Llana's timezone should match your data source, for example if your data source is running on UTC then you can add `TZ=UTC` to your `.env`

If they are not hosted in the same location you may need to set this manually. 

## Examples

Here are some common example configuration use cases:

### Restricted By Host, No User Authentication

This use case could be an internal database, not accessed by clients but connected to other internal services. 

- It is locked down by `HOSTS` which means only that host can access, everything else will get a `403 Forbidden` response.
- `SKIP_AUTH` has been added, so no user authentication is requires, all requests coming from the valid host will pass.

```
DOMAIN="llana.domain"
DATABASE_URI=********
HOSTS="123.123.123.123"
SKIP_AUTH=true
SKIP_DOCS=true
```
