# Configuration 

Llana's basic implementation can be configured quickly using `.env` values which will connect to your data source and configure other basic options.

More advanced configuration is done via data tables (`_llana_*`) which we add dynamically to your data source.

We do this to ensure the application is fully cloud based and there is no dependency on the file system.

## Database

Replace the database connection string `DATABASE_URI` in the `.env` file.

[See data sources](/data-sources/overview) for more information.

## Hosts

You can lock down requests to specific hosts by passing a comma separated list of hosts via the `HOSTS` `.env` property.

*Warning*: By default the system has no hosts and is open to all. We highly recommend you restrict your application to known hosts. 

## Authentication 

As standard we ship with two types of authentication with some examples added, however if you are developing a public application you can skip authentication by adding `SKIP_AUTH=true` to your `.env` file.

This will remove the need for any user authentication and make all your endpoints public. Endpoints will be `READ` only as standard, see [Auth Inclusions and Exclusions](/configuration#auth-inclusions-and-exclusions) to change this. 

### API KEY

Here are the configuration settings and their default settings:

|Env Key | Default | Details|
|--------|---------|--------|
|`AUTH_USER_API_KEY_LOCATION` | `HEADER` | The location of where the API Key is passed in the requests, options are: `HEADER` `QUERY` `BODY`|
|`AUTH_USER_API_KEY_NAME` | `x-api-key` | The key of the key:value pair passed, e.g. `x-api-key:YOURKEY` |
|`AUTH_USER_TABLE_NAME` | `User` | The main identity table containing your user identity|
|`AUTH_USER_IDENTITY_COLUMN` | undefined | The column containing your users identity key in your users identity table, defaults to the primary key of the identity table|
|`AUTH_USER_API_KEY_FIELD`| `UserApiKey.apiKey` | The column of the users API key accessed from the main identity table|

*Note*: if you specify a `SOFT_DELETE_COLUMN` it will ensure this value is `NULL` before authorizing.

### JWT Token

We provide some special endpoints that allows you to exchange a username/password for a `access_token`. You can then pass the access token in future requests.

#### Login

Example Request:

```
POST `/auth/login`

body: {
  username: test@test.com,
  password: test
}

```

Example Response: 

```
{
    "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOjEsInVzZXJuYW1lIjoidGVzdEB0ZXN0LmNvbSIsImlhdCI6MTcyNTM1NDI4OCwiZXhwIjoxNzI1NDQwNjg4fQ.Wb_Y6y1Mkb0xrhUX57s2XlKtqeZ5L68wNCVMWT8wFJw",
    "id": 1
}
```

#### Profile

You can test your access token by using the `/auth/profile` endpoint which also returns your users table data.

```
GET `/auth/profile`
```

Example Response: 

```
{
    "id": 1,
    "email": "test@test.com",
    "first_name": "Jon",
    "last_name": "Doe"
}
```

#### JWT Configuration  

You will need to add / update your `.env` values to fit your database schema:

|Env Key | Default | Details|
|--------|---------|--------|
|`AUTH_USER_TABLE_NAME` | `User` | The main identity table containing your user identity|
|`AUTH_USER_IDENTITY_COLUMN` | undefined | The column containing your users identity key, defaults to the primary key of the identity table|
|`AUTH_USER_TABLE_USERNAME_FIELD`| `email` | The column of your username field in the user identity table|
|`AUTH_USER_TABLE_PASSWORD_FIELD`| `password` | The column of your password field in the user identity table|
|`AUTH_USER_TABLE_PASSWORD_ENCRYPTION`| `BCRYPT` | The encoding type for your password field, options are: `BCRYPT` `SHA1`, `SHA256`, `SHA512`, `MD5`, `ARGON2`|
|`AUTH_USER_TABLE_PASSWORD_SALT`| 10 | Optional salt used in conjunction with the encryption |


### Auth Inclusions and Exclusions

By default authentications apply to all tables, however you can add specific inclusions or exclusions for more granular authentication support.

This allows you to open and close specific data sets to the public.

You can maintain routes in the table `_llana_auth`.

|Field | Type | Details|
|--------|---------|--------|
|`auth` | `enum` | Which auth type this applies to, either `APIKEY` or `JWT` |
|`type` | `enum` | If to `INCLUDE` or `EXCLUDE` the endpoint, excluding means authentication will not be required |
|`table` | `string` | The table this rule applies to |
|`public_records` | `enum` | The permission level if `EXCLUDE` and opened to the public, either `NONE` `READ` `WRITE` `DELETE`|

Any exclusions should also include a `public_records` permission, otherwise we will default to `READ` only

### Password Encryption

To help ensure user passwords are always stored in an encrypted format, we perform checks on `CREATE` and `UPDATE` requests. If the request includes an update to your users identity table and includes the password field, we will encrypt the password using your configures (or default) encryption method.

This means you can delegate the user password encryption entirely to Llana.

## Roles

User roles are an important part of granting the correct permissions to perform relevant actions on the API endpoints.

Firstly, you should configure where your roles are located:

|Env Key | Default | Details|
|--------|---------|--------|
|`ROLE_LOCATION_USER_TABLE_NAME` | `$AUTH_USER_TABLE_NAME` | The table containing your roles, defaults to your auth users table |
|`ROLE_LOCATION_USER_TABLE_ROLE_FIELD` | `role` | The column containing your users role type |
|`ROLE_LOCATION_USER_TABLE_IDENTITY_COLUMN`| `undefined` | The column containing your users identity key, defaults to the primary key of the identity table |

You can manage roles via the `_llana_role` table.

|Field | Type | Details|
|--------|---------|--------|
|`custom` | `boolean` | If this is a custom role (applies to specific endpoints) |
|`table` | `string` | If not default, which table does this restriction apply to |
|`identity_column` | `string` | If not default and the primary key of the table is not the user identifier, which column should be used to identify the user |
|`role` | `string` | The name of the role, which should match the value from your users role field |
|`records` | `enum` | The permission level for this role across all records in the table, either `NONE` `READ` `WRITE` `DELETE`|
|`own_records` | `enum` | The permission level for this role if it includes a reference back to the user identity (their own records) either `NONE` `READ` `WRITE` `DELETE`|

By default we will add the following roles to the table if non-exist on application startup:

|Custom | Table | Identity | Role | Records | Own Records |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|---------|----------|
|`false` ||| `ADMIN` | `DELETE` |  | 
|`false` ||| `EDITOR` | `WRITE` | |  
|`false` ||| `VIEWER` | `READ` | | 
|`true` | `$AUTH_USER_TABLE_NAME` | | `ADMIN` | `DELETE` | `DELETE` | 
|`true` | `$AUTH_USER_TABLE_NAME` | | `EDITOR` | `NONE` | `WRITE` | 
|`true` | `$AUTH_USER_TABLE_NAME` | | `VIEWER` | `NONE` | `WRITE` | 
|`true` | `$AUTH_USER_API_KEY_TABLE_NAME` | `$AUTH_USER_API_KEY_TABLE_IDENTITY_COLUMN` | `ADMIN` | `DELETE` | `DELETE` | 
|`true` | `$AUTH_USER_API_KEY_TABLE_NAME` | `$AUTH_USER_API_KEY_TABLE_IDENTITY_COLUMN` | `EDITOR` | `NONE` | `WRITE` | 
|`true` | `$AUTH_USER_API_KEY_TABLE_NAME` | `$AUTH_USER_API_KEY_TABLE_IDENTITY_COLUMN` | `VIEWER` | `NONE` | `WRITE` |

Role permissions work progressively, which means:

* `DELETE` - Has full permission to `DELETE` `WRITE` and `READ` 
* `WRITE` - Can also `READ` records
* `READ` - Can only `READ` records and has no `WRITE` permissions
* `NONE` - Has no access to the table

If the user has insufficient permissions they will get a `403 Forbidden` response.

## System Cache

Out of the box we cache table schema and some user auth/identity data to help speed up requests and reduce load on the database. 

The cache is reset each time the application boots up, this means if you make database schema changes, you can simply reboot the application and the cache will be cleared.

This allows us to set a longer-lived cache ttl, however, if you want to change these, you can set the, in the `.env` file. Setting a ttl to `0` will result in no cache being used.

```
CACHE_TABLE_SCHEMA_TTL=3600000 #value in milliseconds
CACHE_IDENTITY_DATA_TTL=60000 #value in milliseconds
```
