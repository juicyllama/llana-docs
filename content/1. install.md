# Install

Docker is likely the best option for running the application locally or in production. 

You can use our prebuilt Docker image for production or if you want full control, fork or clone from GitHub.

## Github

If you are looking to contribute to the project, first fork the repository and clone it from your own GitHub account. This way you can create pull requests and contribute to the open-source project.

Clone the repository then run the application locally either inside or outside of Docker.

```
git clone git@github.com:juicyllama/llana.git
```

### Running outside docker

Llama is built using [NestJs](https://nestjs.com/). If you are unfamiliar with that framework, we recommend reading their documentation

Once cloned, run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm run start:dev
```

For production, you would use:

```
npm run start
```

## Docker

### Running Locally

Once you have the application code on your machine (see #Github), before proceeding, install Docker Desktop.

```
npm run docker:dev
```

This will build the local images and container. Once complete, you can then access the application by opening: http://localhost:3000

### Docker Image

You can import a production-ready version of Llama via this Docker image: `juicyllama/llana:latest`

For example: 

```
Docker pull juicyllama/llana:latest
```

Note: This does not ship with any databases installed as it expects you to connect to your live database.
