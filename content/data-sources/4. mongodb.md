# MongoDB

`DATABASE_URI` format should be `mongodb://<user>:<pass>@<host>:<port>/<database>`

Example:

```
DATABASE_URI=mongodb://user:pass@localhost:27017/llana
```

## Relations

MongoDb can handle relational data in a few different ways:

### Embedded data

Embedded data will be returned in your results when selecting the column data, it will be returned as JSON.

### ObjectId's (Matching Column/Table Names)

If your column name matches the referring tables name, we will automatically detect the relationship and you will not need to do anything.

###Â ObjectId's (Different Column/Table Names)

As we have no way of connecting the data, you would need to maintain the `_llana_relation` table which is our way of building relational data into non-relational data sources.
