# MongoDB

[MongoDb](https://www.mongodb.com/) is the most popular NoSQL database application.

## Configuration

`DATABASE_URI` format should be `mongodb://<user>:<pass>@<host>:<port>/<database>`

Example:

```
DATABASE_URI=mongodb://user:pass@localhost:27017/llana
```

## Relations

MongoDb can handle relational data in a few different ways:

### ObjectIds (Matching Column/Table Names)

If your column name matches the referring tables name, we will automatically detect the relationship and you will not need to do anything.

###Â ObjectIds (Different Column/Table Names)

As we have no way of connecting the data, you would need to maintain the `_llana_relation` table which is our way of building relational data into non-relational data sources.
