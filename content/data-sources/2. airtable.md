# Airtable

[Airtable](https://airtable.com) is a popular web based data storage solution.

## Configuration

Set your `DATABASE_URI` Environment Variable to `airtable://<pat>@<baseId>`

Example:

```
DATABASE_URI=airtable://pat***@app***
```

### PAT

You can generate a PAT via your Airtable account, you will need to give the PAT the following scopes:

- `data.records:read`
- `data.records:write`
- `schema.bases:read`
- `schema.bases:write`

Along with access to your workspace.

### BaseId

Open your database in Airtable and check the URL string. In between each backslash, you will find a string that identifies the base, table, and view IDs.

- Base IDs begin with "app"
- Table IDs begin with "tbl"
- View IDs begin with "viw"

### Testing

As Airtable is a web based data source and cannot be run via Docker, you should follow these steps if you wish to test the Airtable integration:

1. Create Airtable account at https://airtable.com/
2. Ensure the `DATABASE_URI` is set
3. Import demo data by running this command `npm run seed:airtable`
4. Run the test suite command `npm run test:current`
