# Local Development

Out of the box you can use our docker demo data to play with the system. 

We are using this helpful [database sample repository](https://github.com/harryho/db-samples) to build demo database examples. We add a `User` table and a `UserApiKey` table to facilitate the authentication. 

You can use the following user details for testing:

Email: `test@test.com`
Password: `test`
API key: `Ex@mp1eS$Cu7eAp!K3y`

## Debugging & Logging

You can change the log level via `.env` value `LOG_LEVELS` which expects a comma separated list of levels:

```
LOG_LEVELS = "error,warn,log,debug,verbose"
```

To assist with debugging we accept the header property `x-request-id` in all requests, if this is passed, we will echo this with all logs for this specific request/response. This allows you to filter your logs and helps narrow debugging on busy applications. We will also pass `_x_request_id: value` in any response object.
