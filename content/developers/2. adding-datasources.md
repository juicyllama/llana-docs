# Adding Data Sources

Below is a step by step guide to adding a new data source, useful for developers wanting to support a new database, data storage tool or other form of data source.

1. Add the demo database / file in the `demo/databases` folder
2. If applicable add this new data source to the development docker instance for local testing
3. Add the new `Enum` to the `DatabaseType` object inside `src/types/database.types.ts` with the name of the new data source
4. Add the ability to detect the database type from the `DATABASE_URI` in the `getDatabaseType()` function at `src/helpers/Database.ts` 
5. Create a new `src/databases/{name}.database.ts` file which handles all of the interactions with the data source. Review the other files to see which functions are needed.
6. Register the new injectable as a `provider` and `export` in the `app.module.ts`
7. Add the new switch case to each function inside `src/helpers/Query.ts` to wire up the new database file.
8. Do the same for the `getSchema()` function inside `src/helpers/Schema.ts`
9. Ensure all test pass using this data source in your `.env`.
10. Add the new data source test script e.g. `test:datasource` to `package.json` and to `scripts/test.sh` file for automated testing
11. Submit a PR for a review from our core team. If you have credentials to a testing environment please include them.
