# Adding Data Sources

Below is a step by step guide to adding a new data source, useful for developers wanting to support a new database, data storage tool or other form of data source.

1. Add the demo database / file in the `demo/databases` folder
2. If applicable add this new data source to the development docker instance for local testing
3. Add the new `Enum` to the `DatabaseType` object inside `src/types/database.types.ts` with the name of the new data source
4. Add the ability to detect the database type from the `DATABASE_URI` in the `getDatabaseType()` function at `src/helpers/Database.ts` 
5. Create a new `src/databases/{name}.database.ts` file which handles all of the interactions with the data source. Review the other files to see which functions are needed.
6. Add the new switch case to each function inside `src/helpers/Query.ts` to wire up the new database file.
7. Do the same for the `getSchema()` function inside `src/helpers/Schema.ts`
8. Ensure all test pass using this data source in your `.env`.
9. Submit a PR for a review from our core team. If you have credentials to a testing environment please include them.
